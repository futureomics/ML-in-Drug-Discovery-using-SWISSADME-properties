**🧬 ML in Drug Discovery using SWISSADME Properties**

This repository presents a machine learning (ML) approach to aid drug discovery using molecular properties derived from SWISSADME — a free web tool that computes physicochemical descriptors and predicts ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) parameters, pharmacokinetic properties, drug-likeness, and more.

**🚀 Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to build and evaluate ML models that predict drug-likeness or other biological activities based on SWISSADME-derived features. It supports the early stages of drug discovery by filtering out compounds with poor pharmacokinetic profiles.

**🧪 Key Features**
**🧾 Data Processing:** Extraction and cleaning of molecular descriptors from SWISSADME.

**🤖 ML Modeling**: Training and evaluation of multiple ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost).

**📊 Visualization:** Plots for feature importance, correlation heatmaps, and model performance.

**📈 Metrics**: Accuracy, precision    recall  f1-score, etc.

**✅ Drug-likeness Evaluation**: Based on Lipinski’s Rule of Five and other filters.

**🛠️ Packages Used**

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Matplotlib, Seaborn

RDKit (optional for molecular structure handling)
